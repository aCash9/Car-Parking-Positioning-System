# Car-Parking-Positioning-System

The project is about a parking positioning system that provides drivers with real-time information about the availability of parking spaces in a large parking area. The system utilizes IR (infrared) sensors that are programmed using the Arduino IDE. The IR sensors are used to detect the presence and location of parked vehicles, and the information gathered by the sensors is then processed and displayed on an external device such as a laptop or smartphone. The goal of the project is to improve the efficiency of parking facilities, reduce the need for new parking infrastructure, and make the parking experience more convenient and less stressful for drivers. The use of the Arduino IDE to program the IR sensors provides a user-friendly platform for the development and customization of the system. The system is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing it to be easily adapted to meet the changing needs of drivers and parking facilities.
